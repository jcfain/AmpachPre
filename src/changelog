Pre-buffering is in! (no pun intended)
	It's not "true" pre-buffering, but it works. What I mean by not true pre buffering is. If you have a short song
	and a long song after the short one. the long one will probably need to buffer but the next one should be buffered
	and ready to go. unless you skip it of course.
	note: pre-buffering is not working in random mode yet.

swipe to delete accounts. Tap the icon to edit that account.
		IMPORTANT!!! delete all your old ampachpre accounts before upgrading to 1.7.5. or they will be left in your memory.

A lot of work went into random play. The over all random play experience should be better now.
Random play should not repeat any songs now.
Added skip ahead 10 secs and skip back 10 sec commands
Moved the commands on now playing screen
Added next track status.

IMPORTANT! before upgrading to 1.8... If you have any downloads you would like to keep listed in ampachpre,

	connection port: same as above but for all encrypted transactions.
	the address field is now just the domain name
	the directory field is for the path ampache resides in.
downloads now save into a directory of the playlist name. /media/internal/yourPersonalPath/playlistName/artist/album/song.mp3
a notification presents the song  and artist that is now playing if the app is minimized or the phone is asleep.
there is a option to turn notifications off as well.
re-designed Albums of the moment.
	now a palm list and I have increased performance by like 500% (i dont really know the increased performance but its way better)
	the album list is now cached after the initial toggle. to refresh the albums of the moment cache simply login again.

How-to back up your AmpachPre database:

1. Before deleting AmpachPre, plug in your phone to a pc usb port and hit "Usb Drive". Or you can use sftp/ssh what ever you please.
2. Navigate to ".app-storage/file_.var.usr.palm.applications.net.nucleardecay.ampachpre_0"
3. There should be a file in there named "00000000000000xx.db" where xx can be any two hexidecimal digits.
4. Copy this file to a safe place say your Desktop.
5. Now you can eject/unmount your phone and delete AmpachPre by Orange+Tap.
6. Reinstall Ampachpre and wait for the account screen to come up.
7. Put your phone back into usb mode and navigate to ".app-storage/file_.var.usr.palm.applications.net.nucleardecay.ampachpre_0" again.
8. Note the name of the new "00000000000000xx.db" file in that directory, xx should be increased by 1.
9. Rename the file on your desktop to that of the new file then copy the old one into ".app-storage/file_.var.usr.palm.applications.net.nucleardecay.ampachpre_0" 
over writing the new smaller file.
10. restart AmpachPre and your data base should be there.

Note: for this install I moved the account system to the database so from now on this procedure will keep all accounts. This time only you will
need to enter your account info again.

It is strongly recommended you delete and remake your accounts just keep every thing clean, at least re-save your account to keep variables from being null!
if you have problems just remake the account.

also I am very sorry but I found a bug that needs to be fixed and for that to be done you will need to make any saved playlists again. 
	The bug was when you create a playlist with the same name as a downloaded playlist name Ampachpre would fill that playlist with your downloaded playlist.
	causing you to not be able to delete the saved playlist without deleting the database that held the downloaded playlist. 
	this is kind of ironic because i just spent about a hr. on makeing a big playlist tonight.
	the good news is downloads will not be affected :D
	
added a wifi check if you are on wifi it will auto log you into the account you specify as default wifi.
added a ssid field; you need to specify your home ssid incase you are on a wifi somewhere other than the place your server is at.
	this should not affect your account if you choose not to use this option. 
new auto account change feature. If you in any scene and you turn on wifi or vice versa, or if you just got out of the range of your router or if your wan ip has changed.
AmpachPre will now auto login to either your default wifi or evdo account. (still experimental while streaming.)
last fm scrobbling now native. You need to disable scrobbling in Ampache if you want to use this feature. If you dont, just leave the account info blank.
if you choose to use this you will be able to turn scrobbling Off/On by default or toggle it from the app menu on the stream scene.
ad all to playlist on a downloaded playlist added.
if you have a song that has been downloaded from a url and there is no time in the playlist. It will be added the first time you play it.
this fixes a bug that caused the playlist scene from not displaying total playlist time when these files where added to the playlist.
there has been a ping timer to keep the api Session alive added that is customizable. Still working on the stream session. 
added a search time out if the search takes longer than 30 seconds the search will be canceled.
added the ability to edit playlist song info for scrobbling songs with bad tags and for those like me who just do not have time to go through thier entire mp3 collection looking for bad tags. 
	(I strongly recommend not editing either the image url nor the song url! I was going to disable these but you could enter a full path to a local mp3 and image file if you know the values. Remote mp3z are unsupported right now.)
added a download saved playlist function in case you need it quick.

If you search "All" with a empty search field, you will be given a option to browse by artist, album or songs. (note: i have 15000+ songs, browse songs crashes Ampachpre for me.)
Added a boolean option to search incase you know exactly what you want.
you can now rename saved playlists(this should update any pre 1.8.3 playlists that where not deleted before upgrading. Just change the name and save)
now if you listen to more than half a song or the song has elapsed 260 seconds and you skip or close stream scene. The song will be scrobbled. (note: it doesnt look like there is enough time to scrobble if you just close the app while playing)
added options for turning on/off bluetooth and headphone controls.
added version/account settings checker, now is any settings are updated with a new version, ampachpre will auto set them to the default value and tell you whats new.
changed the style of the account scene.
fixed a bug where if you left the ping interval field blank the account would not save.
